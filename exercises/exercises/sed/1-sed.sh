# SED command in UNIX stands for stream editor and it can perform lots of functions on file like searching, find and replace, insertion or deletion.
# Though most common use of SED command in UNIX is for substitution or for find and replace.
# By using SED you can edit files even without opening them, which is much quicker way to find and replace something in file, than first opening that file in VI Editor and then changing it.
#
