# TnS Bash course

This course is an introduction to basic bash concepts. You can find the latest version here: https://github.com/cheurtetns/BashCourse \
In the exercices/exercices folder you will find all the exercices.\
In the exercices/solutions folder you will find all the solutions.

## Start the course
To start the course, run the following commands:
```
cd exercices
bash run.sh
```
## To do list:

- [x] Find another method to know that the user updated its exercice script, not using the date
- [x] For 1-guess_game.sh, handle CTRL+C behavior. Currently it stops run.sh whereas it should stop the script launched in 1-guess_game.sh
- [ ] Develop new exercices. All concepts have not yet been treated and others could be deepened
- [ ] Develop some tests. Seems only relevant for some exercices (ex: func1.sh, not 1-sed.sh)
